Simple functional discord bot allowing for user management, polls, activity monitoring, and much more. All you need to do is create a discord application, generate a token, and add that token to this script. If your script is running, the bot will be online and can be interacted with. I recommend using Heroku or similar to host a worker script, as I found that to be the easiest way to run this bot.
